This is a fun project where I create different aspects of operating systems/ embedded systems in c or assembly or python, then reverse engineer them using different tools, ghidra or radare2 or other fun things I find.

Each project in this repo will come equipped with a step-by-step process, viz.:
1. The standard program to run via terminal (code documented for novice to follow)
2. Documentation of vulnerabilities in specific focus of project that day
3. Play-by-play of exploitation
4. Summary of what the program does apropos of architecture, memory, registers, etc. (:
5. Binaries!

This is an education repo for the purpose of understanding x86 architecture, vulnerabilities in my creations, and explorations of computer memory.

This project is a lot of fun and I hope you learn something about computer science with me (:

Each project will be broken down into the following points in their distinct README file:

0. Intent
1. Memory management breakdown and logic therefrom
2. Risk analysis of program based on myriad of considerations
3. Fun stuff regarding tools to use
4. Methodology to reverse
5. Conclusion as to what made the program safe and what made it unsafe from the outset, as well as what was learned (:
