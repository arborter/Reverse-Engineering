This is a fun project where I create different aspects of operating systems/ embedded systems in c or assembly or python, then reverse engineer them using different tools, ghidra or radare2 or other fun things I find.

Each project in this repo will come equipped with a step-by-step process, viz.:
1. The standard program to run via terminal (code documented for novice to follow)
2. Documentation of vulnerabilities in specific focus of project that day
3. Play-by-play of exploitation
4. Summary of what the program does apropos of architecture, memory, registers, etc. (:
5. Binaries!

This is an education repo for the purpose of understanding x86 architecture, vulnerabilities in my creations, and explorations of computer memory.

This project is a lot of fun and I hope you learn something about computer science with me (:
